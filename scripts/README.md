# the scripts: important notes
if you wish to check out the source game, i strongly recommend you download the "source.rbxl" file on the [root directory](https://github.com/gameboy333/pickle/tree/main) of the repo, as all scripts in here are included there.\
i don't have specific source building instructions yet, but i'll add them if requested

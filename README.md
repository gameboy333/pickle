## faq
### will there be mobile support?
maybe.. i dont think the movement will be very fair on mobile (as you need to turn your camera around a lot) and it will probably complicate things
### the ui sucks! make it better!!
the ui is meant to be minimalistic\
\
also: if you come from the high seas, the other project in the battle may have better ui, but i strongly recommend you primarily judge this project based on gameplay, or how cool the movement is. you can still judge about design if you want, but the design will probably remain this way.
### am i supposed to be able to swing to target blocks from (almost) anywhere?
yes. i will make a level that uses that feature soon, but i need to make a system where if you're like 7 studs off the target block's position, it will still swing you to the target block.
### i think i found a bug / i have feedback i want to share
you can contact me on hack club's slack about it, by clicking the "Chat on Slack" button on this project's wonderdome panel.
